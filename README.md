Don't even think of inting if you're a white name, If I int first or you're a friend of a friend it's fine. Otherwise, kindly, f off. 

Usually offtab working . C+H always encouraged unless with friends.

I'm often sitting with @ccrny , @arrowhazard , @curse-manipulation , @miss-ayase , @5uguru and @TombaRompa
